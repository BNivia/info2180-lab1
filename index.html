        <p>This is a paragraph about myself. Cheeky, I know. Web Development has a strong hand in Software Engineering ,which is what I want to do,
            which I discovered in the last few months so it was a no brainer. Additionally, I thought it would be fun and 
            its a very popular course apparently.
